<h2 id="circular-queue"><strong>Circular Queue</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>A Circular Queue is a type of queue in which the last location of the queue is connected to the first location of the queue. (i.e if we have a circular queue with 5 location then the 5th location is connected back to the 1st location).</li>
<li>It overcomes the problem of unutilized space in linear queue where in order to add new elements more then the size of the queue we had to delete all the previous data. We can do so by adding new data at the location from where data is deleted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="priority-queue"><strong>Priority Queue</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Priority Queue is a type of queue in which the elements have been assigned priority and the processing of different operation is done according to the priorities. The processing is done as:-
<ul>
<li>Element with higher priority is processed first</li>
<li>Elements with same priorities are processed in order they were added to the queue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are two types of Priority Queue:- <code>Ascending priority queue and Descending priority queue</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="stack"><strong>Stack</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Stack is a linear data structure in which data items are inserted and deleted at one end of the structure. It works in LIFO manner(Last In First Out) which means the data that is inserted/Pushed at last will be deleted/Popped first from the stack.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="linked-list"><strong>Linked List</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Linked list is a linear collection of data elements that are linked with one another. The datas are stored in a node like structure and each node consists of two fields. The <code>information field</code> where actual data is kept and <code>address field</code> which holds the memory address of the next element. The address field of last element points to NULL.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Doubly Linked List is a type of linked list in which each node not only consists of information and next element address field but also a additional field that holds the address of the previous node. The address field holding address of previous node of the first node and the address field holding the address of net node of the last node is pointed to NULL</li>

<h2 id="enqueue-and-dequeue"><strong>Enqueue and Dequeue</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Enqueue is the process of inserting an element at the end of the queue that is at the rear of the queue.</li>
<li>Dequeue is the process of deleting and inserting element at either end of the queue but not in the middle. It is of two types:- <code>input restricted</code> and <code>output restricted</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="linear-and-non-linear-data-structure"><strong>Linear and Non-linear Data structure</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Linear Data structure are those type of data structure which have data elements connected sequentially. All the elements are present at a single level. Example:- Array, lists, Queue, etc.</li>
<li>Non-linear Data structure are those type of data structure which have data elements connected hierarchically. Elements are present at different levels. Example:- Map, Tree, Graph, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="stable-and-unstable-sorting"><strong>Stable and Unstable Sorting</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>A stable sorting algorithm are those sorting algorithm that maintains the order of same keys in the original problem even in its sorted form. Example:- Merge sort, Bubble sort, insertion sort, etc.</li>
<li>A unstable sorting algorithm are those sorting algorithm that doesn’t maintain the order of same keys in the original problem in its sorted result. i.e the order is altered. Example:- Quick sort, heap sort, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="hashing-and-collision"><strong>Hashing and Collision</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hashing is the process of making data table using hash functions that converts the given bigger data into smaller key and use them as index. It is used to store data that are bigger in size by breaking them down into smaller keys.</li>
<li>When hashing list of data some data may yield same key, when two or more data hashes same keys then that condition is called collision in hashing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="collision-resolving-technique"><strong>Collision Resolving technique</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>To handle collision we have two main techniques:-
<ol>
<li>Open hashing (Separate chaining)
<ul>
<li>It is the method in which each cell of the table where collision occurs points to a linked list.</li>
<li>It is used mostly when we don’t know the number of datas to be inserted or deleted.</li>
<li>Advantage:-
<ul>
<li>It is simple to implement.</li>
<li>Hash table never fills up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantage:-
<ul>
<li>If the chain becomes long, searching time becomes long.</li>
<li>Uses extra spaces for links</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Closed hashing (Open addressing)
<ul>
<li>It is the method in which each data is stored in the hash table itself.</li>
<li>It is used when the number of datas to be inserted or deleted is known.</li>
<li>Advantage:-
<ul>
<li>No extra spaces for links.</li>
<li>Every slot of the hash table is used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Disadvantage:-
<ul>
<li>It requires more computation.</li>
<li>Clustering and load factor may occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There are three ways of obtaining Closed hashing:-
<ol>
<li>Linear probing
<ul>
<li>It is the method in which probing (Searching for next empty slot) is linear.</li>
<li>Clustering occurs while using this method as more collision occurs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Quadratic probing
<ul>
<li>It is the method in which probing is quadratic.</li>
<li>It works in i2 in i’th iteration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Double hashing
<ul>
<li>It is the method in which a second hashing function is done for the same key.</li>
<li>Clustering is not encountered but time for 2 hashing functions is more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="hash-function-and-hash-tables"><strong>Hash function and Hash tables</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Hash functions are those functions that are used to break down the bigger sized data into smaller key that are used as index to store the data.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="graph-connected-graph-and-digraph"><strong>Graph, Connected Graph and Digraph</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>A Graph is a set of nodes(or vertices) and a set of arcs(or edges). Each arc in a graph is specified by a pair of nodes.</li>
<li>A connected graph is a graph that is connected, i.e every vertex in the graph is connected with at least one other vertex.</li>

<li>A weight balanced tree is a binary tree that has balanced weight, i.e the difference between the left subtree leaves to the right subtree leaves is not more than 1.(<code>leaves are the nodes in the tree that doesn't have any child node</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="what-is-b-tree"><strong>What is B+ tree</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>A B+ tree is a generalized form of BST(Binary Search tree) where all the datas are present at the leaf nodes only where as the internal and root node contains the index pointing to the data. The leaf nodes are also connected with each other with a linked list.</li>

</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Repeat step 3 for every character in the infix expression</li>
<li><strong>Step 5:</strong> If <code>all the characters are read and the stack is not empty</code> then pop all the operators from the stack append to the output list and the postfix expression is gained.</li>

<ul>
<li>Tree traversal is the process of visiting every node in a tree at once. It is used in many application in order to find specific node to delete or add node to that node, etc.</li>
<li>There are different ways of traversing a tree. They are classified according to the order of nodes they visit. They are:-
<ol>
<li>Pre-Order (NLR)
<ul>
<li>In this way of traversing the tree we first visit the root node and visit its left node followed by its right node.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In-Order (LNR)
<ul>
<li>In this way of traversing the tree we first visit the left most node then its parent node followed by the right node.</li>
</ul>

<li>Sorting is the operation of arranging data in some given order such as increasing or decreasing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="quick-sort"><strong>Quick Sort</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Quick sort is a divide and conquer sorting algorithm used to sort list of array by dividing the list into sublist and recursively sorting each sub-lists.</li>
<li>It has a very good average case behavior among all the sorting techniques.</li>
<li>In quick sort we make partition of the array and choose a key value called pivot and rest of the elements are grouped into two partition such as:-
<ul>
<li>One partition contains elements smaller than key value</li>
<li>Another partition contains elements larger than key value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong><code>Example:</code></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="radix-sort"><strong>Radix Sort</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Radix sort or Bucket sort is a sorting technique that is used to sort the list of positive numbers only. In this sorting technique we initialize an array of size the same as Number of data in the list and all are set to zero. They are called cell of bucket,(hence the Bucket sort).</li>
<li>In first iteration the unit digit numbers are placed in the bucket and sorted, in second iteration tenth digit numbers are sorted and so on.</li>
<li><strong><code>Example:</code></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="selection-sort"><strong>Selection Sort</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>It is one of the simplest form of sorting. In this sort as the name suggest we select a element compare that with all the other elements and interchange the selected element with the compared element if selected element is greater.</li>
<li>After the first iteration the smallest number is placed at the 0<sup>th</sup> index of the list.</li>
<li>Then we select another element and compare that with all the remaining element other than the 0<sup>th</sup> index element.</li>
<li>For list having <code>n</code> elements we have to iterate <code>(n-1)</code> times.</li>
<li><strong><code>Example:-</code></strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="heap-sort"><strong>Heap Sort</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Heap sort is a comparison based sorting technique based on Binary Heap data structure. It is similar to selection sort where we first find the maximum element and place the maximum element at the end. We repeat the same process for the remaining element.</li>
<li>Algorithm for heap sort:-
<ul>
<li>Build a max heap from the input data.</li>
<li>At this point, the largest item is stored at the root of the heap. Replace it with the last item of the heap followed by reducing the size of heap by 1.</li>
<li>Repeat above steps while the size of the heap is greater than 1.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Min heap</strong> is a type of heap in which the value of the parent node must be less than or equal to the values of its children nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Max heap</strong> is a type of heap in which the value of the parent node must be greater than or equal to the values of its children nodes.</li>

<li>It is used when we want to know if a path of certain length from one node to another node exists or not in the given non weighted , directed graph.</li>
<li>Example:- We want to find if a path of length 2 or less exists or not between node <code>a and b</code> then the value of <code>(adj[a][b] || adj~2~[a][b])</code>  must be true <code>where adj and adj~2~ are adjacency matrix for path of length 1 and 2 respectively</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h2 id="deque"><strong>Deque</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Deque abbreviation for Double Ended Queue is a generalized form of Queue, Where the insertion and deletion operation can be done at both the front and rear ends.</li>
<li>As we can insert and delete from both the ends we can implement a Queue as well as a stack using Deque.</li>
<li>Some of the operations of Deque are: <code>insertFront(), insertLast(), deleteFront(), deleteLast(), isEmpty(), isFull(), etc</code></li>
<li>It is used in a dynamic multithreading processing algorithm called work stealing algorithm where one thread can steal work from another thread. By using deque we can implement each thread as deque giving the ability to steal work from one deque by another.</li>
</ul>

<li>
<h2 id="serial-and-parallel-algorithm"><strong>Serial and Parallel algorithm</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Serial algorithm are those type of algorithm that handles the set of operations serially, i.e one at a time. It is the traditional way of handling algorithm. Single processor is needed to handle this type of algorithm. It is easy to implement but can take more time to solve a problem then parallel algorithm.</li>
<li>Parallel algorithm are those type of algorithm that handles multiple set of operations at a given time i.e parallelly. Multiple processor is needed to handle this type of algorithm. It is hard to implement as compared to serial algorithm but takes much less time than that of serial algorithm to solve a certain problem.</li>

<h2 id="game-tree"><strong>Game Tree</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Game Tree is one of the application of trees, where we determine the best next possible move in games like tic-tac-toe, chess, etc after analyzing all the possible moves at the given point of the game.</li>
<li>Although the next best move for that player doesn’t yields ultimate victory for that player as the game tree can only determine the best next move and cannot predict several moves ahead.</li>
<li>The evaluation returns certain numerical result, the higher the result the better the next move and the lower the result the least effective the next move.</li>
