</ul>

<ul>
<li>Defined in 1959 by Herzberg also known as dual or motivation hygiene theiry is the theory of motivation that suggests that motivation can be created and preserved with two factors :- Hygiene factor and Motivational Factor.</li>
<li><strong>Hygiene Factor</strong> are the job factors that doesnot create motivation but preserves it bt preventing dissatisfaction. Example may be <code>pay, job security, physical working conditions, etc</code></li>

<ul>
<li>Defined by <code>VIctor H Vroom</code> in 1964 and further extended by <code>Porter &amp; Lawler</code> in 1968, this theory is based on the assumption that our behaviour is based on making of conscious choice from a set of possible alternative behaviours.</li>
<li>The behaviour we choose will always be the one that maximizes our pleasure and minimizes our pain.</li>
<li>It works in these 3 varaibles:-
<ul>
<li><strong>Expectancy</strong> It tends that if you work hard you will eventually meet the target (<code>i.e performance</code>)</li>
<li><strong>Instrumentality</strong> It tends to the behaviour of accessing for likely rewards they may receive doing the work.</li>
<li><strong>Valence</strong> It tends to the perceived value of the reward by the employee (<code>i.e the satisfaction level</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The formula for <code>Motivational force = Expectancy * Instrumentality * Valence</code></li>
